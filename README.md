# Copyright notes

This project is released under MIT licence, but please note that I've learned most of it from the following sources:
- Epic's Getting Started with Landscapes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMKjIZMPJ0Q), esp. MF_AntiTillingNoise is based on what was shown there and I claim no copyright on it.
- [Unreal Engine 4] Automated Terrain Texturing blog post inspired me how to do slope and height blending http://oliverm-h.blogspot.com/2014/08/unreal-engine-4-automated-terrain.html 
- RATSGAME youtube tutorials showed me how to join both manual and automatic paiting of terrain https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2G_ecHWhZBmEQih1qfe4yIzY49tKxST6

**Textures are CC0** from https://texturehaven.com/. Really excellent stuff, go there for high resolution ones. And if you are able to support Rob - do so :)

FakeWater is based on excelent tutorial by Andrew Hurley https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Water_Shader_Tutorial (largely simplified it, it is just a place holder :) ).
